- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ryugarret, just a newbie developer looking for oportunities lo learn.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in hardware, software and games mainly (trying to making them actually, but I need some code for that)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JAVA, JavaScript, some phython (Fun stuff indeed, I need to port some work here)

Please feel free to comment or whatever you want to do, Surely I'll have some basic repositories with a lot of simple exercises done, but not explained. 
This might seem wrong but I do think that, if you understand what the code does (as it is kinda simple, in my opinion), there's no need for comments on it.
In case you don't understand anything on the code, google it, you'll learn more than you can learn looking at my code, trust me on that one.
